# Statistical Learning
This repository started as a simple translation from R to python.

Currently some light-weighted theory and some additional comments will be added.
The idea is to create an online learning ressource for me.

Following parts are done:
- [regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/regression.ipynb)
- [classification](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/classification.ipynb)
