# Statistical Learning
This repository started as a simple translation from R to python and moved to a small kowledge repository. Each part has a small theoretical introduction, which should give a small overview of the relevant topic. It is not intended to be fully self-explatoratory. The idea is to create an online learning ressource for me to prevent forgetting.

Following parts are done:
- [regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/regression.ipynb)
- [classification](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/classification.ipynb)
- [tree-based-methods](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/tree_based_methods.ipynb) (quite large! plotting of decision trees inside the notebook)
-[cross validation](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/statistical_learning/blob/master/python/cross_validation.ipynb)
